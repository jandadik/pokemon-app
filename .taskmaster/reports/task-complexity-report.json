      "taskTitle": "Implement Collection Management CRUD Operations",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "reasoning": "This task involves implementing a complete CRUD system with controllers, services, and views. It requires handling validation, authorization, and UI components. The complexity is moderate as it follows standard CRUD patterns but requires careful implementation of business rules for default collections and visibility settings.",
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Collection Management CRUD Operations' task into subtasks covering controller implementation, service layer, validation rules, view components, authorization logic, and testing. Include specific subtasks for each CRUD operation and the special business rules for default and public/private collections."

      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Collection Items Management",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "reasoning": "This task is more complex than basic CRUD as it involves managing card variants, detailed card information, and integration with the existing card catalog. The UI requirements for intuitive card searching and variant selection add complexity, as does the need to handle various card attributes like condition, language, and grading.",
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Collection Items Management' task into subtasks covering controller methods, card variant mapping service, form components, catalog integration, validation rules, and UI components. Include specific subtasks for adding, editing, viewing, and removing cards, with special attention to the card search and variant selection process."

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Set Tracking Functionality",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 9,
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to the need to implement different set tracking views (base, master, standard, parallel), calculate completion statistics, and maintain synchronization with collection items. The business logic for set completion rules and the visual representation of progress add significant complexity.",
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Set Tracking Functionality' task into subtasks covering the SetTrackingController, SetCompletionService, view components, completion rule implementation, progress visualization, and synchronization with collections. Include specific subtasks for each tracking view type and the calculation of completion statistics."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Collection Value Tracking",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "reasoning": "This task involves complex financial calculations, historical data tracking, and data visualization. Handling different price sources, currency conversions, and implementing caching strategies for performance optimization with large collections adds significant complexity. The ROI calculations and scheduled jobs for value updates further increase the complexity.",
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Collection Value Tracking' task into subtasks covering the CollectionAnalysisController, PriceTrackingService, scheduled jobs, visualization components, ROI calculations, and caching strategies. Include specific subtasks for handling different price sources, currency conversions, and performance optimization for large collections."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Wishlist Functionality",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "reasoning": "This task involves implementing CRUD operations for wishlists with additional features like priority settings, price thresholds, and notifications. The integration with set tracking and the scheduled job for price monitoring add some complexity, but the overall structure follows standard patterns.",
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Wishlist Functionality' task into subtasks covering the WishlistController, view components, integration with set tracking, price monitoring job, notification system, and filtering/sorting options. Include specific subtasks for priority and price threshold settings and the user interface for managing wishlist items."

      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Collection Statistics and Dashboard",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating complex visualizations, calculating various statistics, and ensuring responsive design. The need to optimize performance with large collections and implement efficient data loading strategies adds complexity. The dashboard must integrate data from multiple sources (collections, set tracking, value tracking).",
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Collection Statistics and Dashboard' task into subtasks covering the dashboard component, statistics calculations, visualization components, data loading strategies, responsive design, and performance optimization. Include specific subtasks for each type of visualization (heatmap, charts) and the integration of data from different sources."

      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Card Variant Selection System",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "reasoning": "This task focuses on creating an intuitive interface for selecting card variants with visual differentiation. The complexity comes from handling multiple variant types, ensuring proper validation, and creating a user-friendly selection process. The integration with the cards_variant table and the need for clear visual representation add complexity.",
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Card Variant Selection System' task into subtasks covering the CardVariantSelector component, backend integration, visual representation of variants, filtering and search functionality, validation logic, and usability testing. Include specific subtasks for each variant type and the integration with the collection item form."

      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Import/Export Functionality",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "reasoning": "This task involves handling data conversion between different formats, implementing validation for imported data, and managing progress tracking for large imports. The complexity comes from ensuring robust error handling and batch processing to avoid timeouts. However, the functionality follows established patterns for import/export systems.",
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Import/Export Functionality' task into subtasks covering the ImportExportService, import/export controllers, data validation, error handling, progress tracking, template generation, and batch processing. Include specific subtasks for each supported format (CSV, Excel) and the handling of large datasets."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Localization System Integration",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "reasoning": "This task involves integrating with an existing localization system rather than building one from scratch. The complexity is moderate, requiring consistent use of translation keys, proper formatting of dates and numbers, and testing in multiple languages. The task spans across all UI components but follows established patterns.",
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Localization System Integration' task into subtasks covering translation key implementation, language file creation, component integration, backend translations, date/number formatting, and testing. Include specific subtasks for each major feature area (collections, set tracking, dashboard) and the verification process for both languages."

      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating a robust synchronization system with both scheduled jobs and real-time event listeners. The complexity comes from handling edge cases, mapping collection items to set tracking requirements, and optimizing performance for large collections. The need for error handling, logging, and monitoring adds additional complexity.",
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Synchronization Between Collections and Set Tracking' task into subtasks covering the synchronization job, event listeners, mapping logic, edge case handling, performance optimization, error handling, logging, and monitoring.
